# A* Path Planning based Maze Solver

# Introduction
This code generates a randomized maze of a specified size and given the start and goal nodes solves the maze to generate a suboptimal path using A* algorithm. The code is written to assist understanding of use of python datastructure to reduce execution time to solve a popular path planning algorithm.

# Algorithm - A* 
A* is like Dijkstra’s Algorithm in that it can be used to find a shortest path. A* is like Greedy Best-First-Search in that it can use a heuristic to guide itself.

The secret to its success is that it combines the pieces of information that Dijkstra’s Algorithm uses (favoring vertices that are close to the starting point) and information that Greedy Best-First-Search uses (favoring vertices that are close to the goal). In the standard terminology used when talking about A*, g(n) represents the exact cost of the path from the starting point to any vertex n, and h(n) represents the heuristic estimated cost from vertex n to the goal. In the above diagrams, the yellow (h) represents vertices far from the goal and teal (g) represents vertices far from the starting point. A* balances the two as it moves from the starting point to the goal. Each time through the main loop, it examines the vertex n that has the lowest f(n) = g(n) + h(n).

    total_path := {current}
    while current in cameFrom.Keys:
        current := cameFrom[current]
        total_path.prepend(current)
    return total_path

# h is the heuristic function. h(n) estimates the cost to reach goal from node n.
function A_Star(start, goal, h)
    """ The set of discovered nodes that may need to be (re-)expanded.
     Initially, only the start node is known.
     This is usually implemented as a min-heap or priority queue rather than a hash-set."""

    # to n currently known.

    # how short a path from start to finish can be if it goes through n.

## Getting Started

These instructions is to help you get started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Numpy
- sympy
- matplotlib

### How To Use
- Run Maze_Solver.py
- On executing the interface asks you for inputs to design the desired maze. The maze creation is randomized but the sparsity and size can be userdefined.
- Start node and End node are needed to be given input and have to be even numbers.
- Assertions are setup for error handling.

## Versioning
- 1.0
    - First Release
    - Future Releases intends to improver performance
